    /// The idea here is to build a tree structure containing always a maximum of K different 
    /// colors. If a further color is to be added to the tree structure, its color value has 
    /// to be merged with the most likely one that is already in the tree. The both values are 
    /// substituted by their mean. 
    ///
    /// The most important data structure are the nodes of the octree. Each inner node of the 
    /// octree contain a maximum of eight successors, the leave nodes keep information for the 
    /// color value (colorvalue), the color index (colorindex), and a counter (colorcount) for 
    /// the pixel that are already mapped to a particular leave. Because each of the red, green 
    /// and blue value is between 0 and 255 the maximum depth of the tree is eight. In level i 
    /// Bit i of RGB is used as selector for the successors. 
    ///
    /// The octree is constructed during reading the image that is to be quantized. Only that 
    /// parts of the octree are created that are really needed. Initially the first K values 
    /// are represented exactly (in level eight). When the number of leaves nodes (currentK) 
    /// exceeds K, the tree has to reduced. That would mean that leaves at the largest depth 
    /// are substituted by their predecessor.
